    An information app for a college event
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I built this app in my first year of college to allow me to be acquainted by
    <mark>Android</mark> concepts. It was just an information app for the event with details
    about the competitions being organised and an option to register if interested
    in the event. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

    This project was a part of my <mark>SIH 2020</mark> submission. We had taken this statement from
    ISRO. We built a neural network for Cloud Detection using Semantic Segmentation on <mark>PyTorch</mark>.
    The user interface for the model consisted of an app built on <mark>Flutter</mark> to enable
    cross platform and multi device compatiblity

    This project carried out sentiment analysis on tweets using <mark>NLP</mark> techniques. The model accepted tweet URL
    as an input and used <mark>web scrapping</mark> to obtain the data. Then we detected whether the tweet contained a
    depressive sentiment or not. If there was a depressive sentiment, the model had an option to notify the
    user as well as local authorities.

    BE Project
  description: |
    This project was a part of my final year project. We built a model to detect vulnerabilities in
    autonomous cars using hacking techniques. We used <mark>AWS Deepracer</mark> as the prototype for the project.
    This provided us a unique opportunity to work with real world data and real world scenarios while still being
    constrained in a safe environment.

    Coursework for the Advanced Software Engineering module
  description: |
    This project was a part of my coursework for the Advanced Software Engineering module. We built a scalable system
    for file encryption and retrieval using containers. The system was built using <mark>Java</mark> for the backend and the frontend
    was made using <mark>Java FX</mark> for creating a basic frontend. <mark>Docker</mark> was used for
    container orchestration. The system was built to be scalable and secure.
