  > AI is the new electricity. Just as electricity transformed almost everything 100 years ago, today I actually have a hard time thinking of an industry that I don't think AI will transform in the next several years.

  This project is a part of the NTU-IBM Watson AI Lab. The aim of this project is to develop a system that can convert grayscale images to colored images. 
  The system will be able to take in a grayscale image and output a colored image. 
  The system will be able to colorize images in real-time
